## Dependencies
***environment***: You need to run ```conda create -n SOD python=3.7 ```.
***pydensecrf***: This package depends on ***pydensecrf***, available via ``` pip install git+https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/pydensecrf.git 
```.   
***opencv3***: This package depends on ***cv2***, available via ``` pip install opencv-python ```.    
***numpy***: This package depends on ***numpy***, available via ``` pip install numpy ```.       

## Usage
### Note : Use Python 3.5
1. put your input (.png) and saliency maps (.png) in images and predictions files, respectively. 
2. set your input_path, sal_path and output_path in densecrf_sal.py.
3. run densecrf_sal.py
4. then, you can see the fine results in the output file.
